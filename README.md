# SmartGW

SmartGW is a VPN Gateway/Proxy that allows you to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic for specific internet domains to go through VPN tunnel while keeping the other traffic goes through your ISP gateway.

**Example:**
- HTTP/HTTPS for **netflix.com** (from all devices in your network) --> Will go through your **VPN tunnel**.
- HTTP/HTTPS for **youtube.com** (from all devices in your network) --> Will go through your **ISP gateway**.

**This can help you to:**
- Access Geo-restricted content.
- Access any blocked domains.
- Use it with all your devices (Laptop, Mobiles, SmartTV...etc).
- Utilize your full ISP network speed to access any site that you don't want it to go through the VPN tunnel.
- More browsing privacy?.

## Features
* Works with all devices in local network (PC, Laptop, Mobiles, SmartTV...etc).
* No need to change any settings in your devices, install SmartGW and configure the DNS in your internet router.
* Simple GUI to check SmartGW status and to add/remove any domain.
* Automatically connect to the fastest low latency VPN servers in a given country.
* Auto retry and auto-failover to next best VPN server if the connection dies.
