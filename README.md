# SmartGW

SmartGW is a VPN Gateway/Proxy that allows you to reroute certain internet domains requests to go through a VPN tunnel while keeping other internet domains goes through your ISP gateway.

**Example:**
- Your request to **netflix.com** (from all devices in your network) --> Traffic to netflix.com will go through the **VPN tunnel**.
- Your request to **youtube.com** (from all devices in your network) --> Traffic to youtube.com will go through your **ISP gateway**.

**This can help you to:**
- Access Geo-restricted content.
- Access any blocked domains.
- Use it with all your devices (Laptop, Mobiles, SmartTV...etc).
- Utilize your full ISP network speed to access any site that you don't want it to go through the VPN tunnel.
- More browsing privacy?.

## Features
* Can work with all your devices in your local network (PC, Laptop, Mobiles, SmartTV...etc).
* No need to change any settings in your devices, install SmartGW and configure the DNS in your internet router.
* Simple GUI to check SmartGW status and to add/remove any domain.
* Can be configured as http proxy to redirect all data to go through the VPN tunnel.
* Automatically connect to least busy, low latency VPN servers in a given country.
* Auto retry and auto-failover to next best VPN server if the connection dies.

## How difficult it's?
The setup is straightforward, you just need a Linux server in your network with a VPN subscription (below instructions support <a href="http://nordvpn.com">NordVPN</a> for now).

## What Do I need to start?
1. You must have a VPN subscription from NordVPN (The method below can work with any VPN provider, but you need to modify the installation script).
2. A Linux server with a static IP in your local network.


## Instructions
1. Install Linux (the instructions below tested with a fresh installation of Ubuntu Server 18.04).
2. Set a static IP in your server.
3. Run SmartGW installer
``` bash
curl -sSL http://bit.ly/Install-SmartGW | bash
```
4. Run below command to complete the VPN setup
``` bash
openpyn --init
```
5. Open your browser and type your SmartGW ip (port 8081) (http://Your-Server-IP:8081/) & define which network interface to use.
6. Define SmartGW IP address as the only DNS entry in the router.
```
Log into your routerâ€™s configuration page and find the DHCP/DNS settings. 
Note: make sure you adjust this setting under your LAN settings and not the WAN.
